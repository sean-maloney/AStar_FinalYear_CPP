# AStar_FinalYear_CPP
<p>This project will Be closely linked to my final year project.</p>

<p>This project aims to mimic a Car Park with different states for different spaces</p>

<p>Parking spot available = Goal</p>
<p>Parking spot unavailable = Obstacle </p>

<p>For this project these will be updated manually, but will be transfered to FYP to work with YOLOv8</p>
